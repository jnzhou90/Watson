
Steadfast. I: ordinary, but not the racket, nor smoke gamble. I'm not rich, also can't give you wealth, but I will when it rains carries an umbrella for you, for your warm hands, when the day is cold danger hug you in my arms, resist everything for you, warm warm caress you for a lifetime. I would like to get up early to do breakfast for you every day, want to sing for you to play the piano, I will draw, I will put our past as many paintings preserved, leaving our children watch, after using the wisps filar silk weaving our happiness of life. But I also have their own dreams, have their own business, when I am in the journey of chasing the dream tired, tired, lost, I hope to have a voice to support me, even if I fell down, broken down, everything is gone, but at least there is a place called 'home', can let me feel warm.
